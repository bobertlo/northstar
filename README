Northstar linux is an experimental linux distribution based on sabotage[1]
linux. Northstar builds its entire userspace statically using the musl[2] C 
standard library.

=== BUILDING NORTHSTAR LINUX ===

To build northstar linux on a foreign linux system, you must first create a
bootstrap toolchain and then a chroot environment. 

=== BUILDING A BOOTSTRAP ENVIRONMENT ===

The bootstrap toolchain is built statically and installed to the prefix $BS
(default: /tmp/bootstrap) which is then mounted read-only at the same point 
inside the chroot.

--- Bootstrap instructions: -----
$ cp dist/bootstrap.config config
$ vi config
$ . config
$ mk install-bootstrap
---------------------------------

At this point there should be toolchain capable of building northstar proper 
inside a chroot. The next step is to prepare the chroot environment and enter 
it.

--- Entering the chroot: --------
$ utils/prepare-chroot
$ utils/mount-chroot
 ... (probably copy in a source tree or something?)
$ utils/enter-chroot
 ... (then when you're done)
$ utils/umount-chroot
